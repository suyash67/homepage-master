With the rise of crypto exchanges for enabling customers own crypto assets, the recent hacks and scams have created a distrust in the minds of customers. I am designing cryptographic protocols as one of the ways to help prevent such undesirable circumstances.</li>

MProve is a recent proof of reserves protocol for Monero. Although equipped with the guarantees of non-collusion, inflation resistance and address privacy, it has some drawbacks. I attempted to overcome those in this work.</li>
