I"t<p>Describing my association with NSS might get too lengthy for it has been a long, adventurous and a beautiful journey. I started volunteering with NSS from my freshman year. I still remember every interaction with the enthusiastic kids whom I taught Science and Math back then. From the second year onwards, I was in the Media and Design team of NSS. Along with volunteering, I also got to learn things like managing time and academics. The satisfaction of my work in NSS kept me motivated to remain associated with the people in NSS. I continued as a Department Head in third year and Overall Coordinator (OC) in fourth.</p>
