<p><a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/735.pdf">Bulletproofs+</a> is a recently proposed range proof which is similar in spirit to <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/1066.pdf">Bulletproofs</a>. Both of these range proof protocols enable proof sizes logarithmic in the number of bits of the range using a recursive inner product protocol. We will try to highlight a small but crucial difference in the design of the two protocols and discuss its implications on their performance.</p>
