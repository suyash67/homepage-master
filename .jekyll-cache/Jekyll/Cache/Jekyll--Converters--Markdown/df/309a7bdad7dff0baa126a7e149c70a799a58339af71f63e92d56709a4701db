I"¢<p>Plasticity is essential component in many biological neural networks, however many state of the art deep learning methods do not incorporate plasticity. Taking inspiration from the main mechanism of learning in biological brains: <em>synaptic plasticity</em>, carefully tuned by evolution to produce efficient lifelong learning, me along with my friend <a href="https://udion.github.io">Uddeshya</a> explored how could plasticity be infused in Deep and Convolutional Neural Networks to enhance the performance in terms of accuracy and memory footprint. We proposed a methodology on how to train such networks and study the effect of plasticity in different settings.</p>
