I"®<p>With the rise of several machine learning and deep learning algorithms, the need for robust and efficient hardware is widely known. Specific to Automatic Speech Recongnition (ASR), conventional Digital Signal Processors (DSPs) do not accommodate the needs of fast and hefty computational requirements of deep learning algorithms. This motivates the design of newer designs of DSPs customizable to deep learning algorithms.</p>
