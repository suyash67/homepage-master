## About Me 

I am a final year student pursuing B.Tech and M.Tech (Dual Degree) in <a href="https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/web">Electrical Engineering</a>, specialising in Communication and Signal Processing,
at the <a href = "http://iitb.ac.in/"> Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay</a>.
I am broadly interested in cryptographic protocols that help strengthen the security and privacy guarantees of cryptocurrencies,
paving way for a decentralized economy.
I worked on <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/project/2019/10/19/eff-proof-of-reserves.html"> Designing Shorter, Privacy-Preserving Proof of Reserves for Cryptocurrency Exchanges</a> as a part of master's thesis, 
guided by <a href="https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/~sarva/"> Prof. Saravanan Vijayakumaran</a>. <br id="paddedlinebreak" />
I have also worked on analysing the confidentiality of amounts in Grin.

<u>Research Interests</u>: Applied Cryptography, Cryptocurrencies, Security & Privacy in Blockchain, Zero-Knowlege Proofs, Neuromorphic Computing

Prior to my work in cryptocurrency research, I have worked with 
<a href="https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/wiki/faculty/udayan">Prof. Udayan Ganguly</a> on 
<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/project/2018/11/30/plasticity-based-learning.html">Plasticity-based Learning</a> and
<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/project/2019/05/01/dybm.html">Dynamic Boltzmann Machines</a>. I also did an internship 
at <a href="https://www.cadence.com">Cadence Design Systems</a>, (Pune, India) under the mentorship of 
<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/vijay-pawar-a620834/">Mr. Vijay Pawar</a> 
on <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/project/2018/08/17/cadence-intern.html">Fast 3D & Depth-separable Convolution on HiFi4 DSP</a>.

Apart from research, I have been actively involved in social service since my freshman year. 
I was an Overall Coordinator of <a href="https://gymkhana.iitb.ac.in/~nss/home/">NSS, IIT Bombay</a> in 2018-'19, 
leading a 3-tier team of 400 volunteers in planning and executing more than 30 initiatives aimed at conserving 
environment, educating the underprivileged and imbibing sustainability in our lives.
