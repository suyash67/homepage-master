## About Me 

I am a Cryptography Engineer at [Aztec](https://aztec.network/index.html). 
I love working on the cryptography aspect of cryptocurrencies and blockchains. 
I am broadly interested in cryptographic protocols that help strengthen the privacy and scalability of cryptocurrencies.

I graduated with a B.Tech and M.Tech in <a href="https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/web">Electrical Engineering</a> from the <a href = "http://iitb.ac.in/"> Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay</a> in June 2020. My [thesis]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/pdfs/suyash-masters-thesis.pdf) was primarily on designing Shorter, Privacy-Preserving Proof of Reserves for cryptocurrency exchanges, guided by <a href="https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/~sarva/"> Prof. Saravanan Vijayakumaran</a>.

<u>Research Interests</u>: Applied Cryptography, Zero-Knowlege Proofs, Cryptocurrencies, Security & Privacy on the Blockchain

Prior to my work in cryptocurrency research, I have worked with 
<a href="https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/wiki/faculty/udayan">Prof. Udayan Ganguly</a> on 
<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/project/2018/11/30/plasticity-based-learning.html">Plasticity-based Learning</a> and
<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/project/2019/05/01/dybm.html">Dynamic Boltzmann Machines</a>. I also did an internship 
at <a href="https://www.cadence.com">Cadence Design Systems</a> (Pune, India)
on <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/project/2018/08/17/cadence-intern.html">Fast Convolution on HiFi4 DSP</a>.

Apart from research, I was actively involved in social service since my freshman year in college. 
I was an Overall Coordinator of <a href="https://gymkhana.iitb.ac.in/~nss/home/">NSS, IIT Bombay</a> in 2018-19, 
leading a 3-tier team of 400 volunteers in planning and executing more than 30 initiatives aimed at conserving 
environment, educating the underprivileged and imbibing sustainability in our lives.
